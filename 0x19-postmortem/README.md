# Postmortem Report

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**
- Start Time: November 10, 2023, 15:30 UTC
- End Time: November 11, 2023, 02:45 UTC

**Impact:**
The outage affected the authentication service, rendering 30% of users unable to log in during the incident. Users experienced login failures, leading to service unavailability for affected accounts.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing intermittent connectivity issues with the authentication server.

## Timeline

- **15:30 UTC:** Issue detected through a surge in error rates on the authentication service.
- **15:35 UTC:** Automated monitoring alerts triggered, notifying the on-call engineer.
- **15:40 UTC:** Initial investigation focused on the authentication server logs to identify any anomalies.
- **16:15 UTC:** Assumption made that the issue might be related to database performance; database servers investigated.
- **17:30 UTC:** Database servers confirmed to be functioning properly. Investigation pivoted to network-related issues.
- **18:45 UTC:** Misleading path: Suspected a DDoS attack; traffic analysis conducted, but no evidence found.
- **20:00 UTC:** Incident escalated to the network engineering team for further analysis.
- **22:30 UTC:** Network team identified misconfiguration in the load balancer settings affecting connectivity to the authentication server.
- **23:15 UTC:** Load balancer settings corrected, and services began to stabilize.
- **02:45 UTC:** Full service restoration confirmed; incident resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused a disruption in the traffic flow to the authentication server. Specifically, an incorrect routing rule was applied, leading to intermittent connectivity issues.

**Resolution:**
The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer settings. The incorrect routing rule was updated to ensure proper distribution of traffic to the authentication servers. Testing was performed to validate the changes and prevent a recurrence.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Things to Improve/Fix:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Implement a regular review process for load balancer configurations to catch potential misconfigurations early.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal patterns in traffic and server performance, providing early warnings for potential issues.
3. **Incident Response Training:** Conduct training sessions for the team to improve incident response times and efficiency in identifying and resolving issues.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Audit:** Schedule a thorough audit of all load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
2. **Automated Traffic Anomaly Detection:** Implement automated systems to detect unusual patterns in network traffic and trigger alerts for immediate investigation.
3. **Incident Response Simulation:** Conduct simulated incident response scenarios to train the team on various outage scenarios and improve response coordination.
